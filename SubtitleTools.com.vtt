00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:18.050
You got some money for me, boy?

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.979
I've seen your name in our legend.

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:28.455
You're a wanted man, Mr. Morgan.

00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:32.533
Maybe when your mother's finished

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.651
mourning your father, I'll keep her in

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:36.131
black on your behalf.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.307
We got it all, man, in three different

00:00:43.307 --> 00:00:45.865
states after us. They chased us from the

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:47.984
West. They chased us over the mountains.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.442
We need an extra gun.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.799
This place. Ain't no such

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.598
thing as civilized.

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:05.875
You're the only one of these fools that I

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:06.154
trust.

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:09.792
Where's your money?

00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:13.900
Do you have my bag?

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:16.549
Always Dutch.
